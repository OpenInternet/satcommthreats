The Sat Phone Safety Guide, by [Fasila](https://www.fasila-inc.com/training) was originally written to support activists in Syria to understand the risks they pose. Ten years later the idea to update this guide was born out of the internet shutdown struggle in Myanmar and the interest from people wanting to learn more about the safety of the satellite phone before using or even purchasing it. 

While the rest of this site is for digital safety practitioners, these guides provide direct and actionable advice for defenders.
